        <h1>Bio</h1>
        <Fieldset>
            <P>I am a first-year BSIT student at Our Lady of Fatima University.
              I'm eager to enhance my knowledge in programming, web development, and modern digital solutions.
              I've realized how big the technology world is and how much potential it has to offer that I want to explore everything the technology world can provide at the same time.
              I want to devote my learning not just to requirements, but to the joy of learning that creates metamorphosis and gives myself a chance to enter the professional IT world stable and ready for anything.
              My passion and dedication will give me the ability to become a developer who will focus on creating quality and efficient innovations.</P>

              <li>Statement Of Account Of The Customer</li>
            </ul>
            <p>One of the most memorable experiences while interning at NHA was the preparation of statements of account regarding housing. 
              It was challenging but also gratifying. Overall, the internship was fruitful; 
              I gained new knowledge, expanded my skills, and connected with positive team players; it was something I appreciated. 
              I understood what it meant to have a vision and how crucial time management was to the achievement of goals. 
              Thus, by the end of the project, I was impressed with myself not only in a technical sense but on a personal level, 
              which was a motivating feeling for future projects.</p>
